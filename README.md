 This repository contains several desktop applications in Python programming language.
 The apps serve as calculators for various variables in management accounting.
 They can compute, for example: profit mark-up and margin, return on investment,
 contribution, marginal and absorption costing profits, budgeting of direct materials
 and labour as well as other values. They enable user inputs and provide widgets for outputs.
